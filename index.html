    <h2>Butters: A History</h2>
    <p>Butters was born to a life of <em>crime</em>. Doomed to be a stray from day 1. She fought tooth and nail... claw to reach her arch nemesis, <a href="http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Professor_Chaos_(character)"><strong>Professor Chaos</strong></a>.
      Chaos, surprised at the sudden confrontation, threw Butters into the waiting hands of an innocent human. Butters mistook this human as a servant of Chaos and proceeded to terrorize them for the rest of her natural life. And probably in death. As a ghost. Cats never forgive.
